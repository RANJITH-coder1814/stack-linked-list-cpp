# Stack Implementation Using Linked List in C++
A C++ implementation of the Stack data structure using a linked list. This project demonstrates core stack operations such as push, pop, peek, and display with dynamic memory allocation, suitable for data structures learning and exam preparation.

## 📌 Description
This project implements the **Stack data structure** in C++ using a **linked list**. Unlike array-based stacks, this implementation does not have a fixed size and uses dynamic memory allocation. The program is menu-driven and easy to understand, making it ideal for beginners and students learning Data Structures.
